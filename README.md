# ui5-portal
A portal / app template structure for API based open UI5 suites.
This project is using the openui5 libraries and has been jump-started by the easy-ui5 generator.

The goal for this project is to provide an easy framework for a landing page of Multi-App OpenUI5 projects that either stand alone or connect to a web-based API. 
The overview / portal page manages the display of the apps in the App-Folder and to obtain a token or variables to be managed around the apps.
